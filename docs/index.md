# vue-path-store

`vue-path-store` is a lightweight shared state management solution for Vue.
At it's heart lays a simple reactive store, that uses the dot notation path syntax for data mutation.  

It also comes with a Vuex plugin flavor so that you can use the dot notation to mutate state in Vuex.
